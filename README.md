# ChessAI
A tree-search based AI which can play Chess (either against itself or a human)

To play, run main.py. Then, once the GUI is launched, open a command-line in the game's root directory and run "AI 0" or "AI 1" respectively representing a 0 player game (AI vs itself) or 1 player game (AI vs human).
